# The database count also limits the number of concurrent tests which depend on Redis and should be increased accordingly if this limit is reached.
# For the best effect, it should be set to at least 10x the number of concurrent tests to reduce the chances of repetition
# when generating the database number per-test.
# 1000 was arbitrarily chosen as a reasonable value.
